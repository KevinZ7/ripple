I feel like I have no purpose in life. I don’t find anything fun, I just want to sleep all day and not talk to anyone. I guess I’m kind of depressed all the time.
Currently suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and struggling with anxiety, depression and abandonment issues due to past trauma from an abusive relationship. Even though I am a victim, I always feel like it’s my fault. I want to overcome this hurt from my past and talk to others who can empathize.
I was always bullied for being fat ever since elementary school. Kids would tease me about my weight and how much food I ate and even adults would scrutinize me. It made me hate my body and develop a borderline eating disorder. But no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t lose weight and I would hate myself which would cause me to binge eat which would make me feel guilty which caused me to want to lose weight, and it still is a vicious cycle I deal with everyday. I want to find someone who can share in my feelings and be positive and encouraging about body image. Preferably someone heavier as well to share common ground.
Even trying the words “my mother died today” feels surreal, but this is my new reality. She has been sick for my entire life, but this truly hit me like a freight train. I’m taking the week off of school, but I’m beyond overwhelmed as is. My anxiety and depression have been in full force since the year began, but this has brought me to new levels of both I could not even imagine. If anyone has any preventive tips for me to combat these feelings, let me know. 
I’m starting to think that I don’t have mental issues and it’s all just an unbreakable behavioral pattern I grew up developing. The more I read about mental health the sadder I get, it feeds my capacity to fail, and failing always leads to subtle destructive behavior that I don’t notice until after the fact. I would think it is something good for me then realize its the opposite and I only did it to run away from the problem. The worst part is now I’m aware of the pattern and so scared of doing anything at all.
It's my 18th birthday. I have no friends. I just feel so alone. My family is trying to make it a good day, even though I said from the start i don't wanna do anything, now there is people coming. I don't know if I can do that. Ive been crying ever since I woke up, sometimes I calm down, but as soon as I stand up I have to cry again. I know I'm making my family feel shitty and they didn't do anything wrong but I just want to be alone.
I just started school and it is very hard for me to make friends. I eat lunch alone and have no one to talk to. My classmates make fun of my behind my back because of how I talk and it's making me very depressed.
I have a midlife crisis because I don't know what my purpose in life is. I can't find a job and I can't get a girlfriend or have any friends in general. I feel like my life is just being wasted away.
