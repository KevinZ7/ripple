0.2519163841167973 | I have a midlife crisis because I dont know what my purpose in life is I cant find a job and I cant get a girlfriend or have any friends in general I feel like my life is just being wasted away

Currently suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder and struggling with anxiety depression and abandonment issues due to past trauma from an abusive relationship Even though I am a victim I always feel like its my fault I want to overcome this hurt from my past and talk to others who can empathize


I was always bullied for being fat ever since elementary school Kids would tease me about my weight and how much food I ate and even adults would scrutinize me It made me hate my body and develop a borderline eating disorder But no matter how hard I tried I couldnt lose weight and I would hate myself which would cause me to binge eat which would make me feel guilty which caused me to want to lose weight and it still is a vicious cycle I deal with everyday I want to find someone who can share in my feelings and be positive and encouraging about body image Preferably someone heavier as well to share common ground


Even trying the words my mother died today feels surreal but this is my new reality She has been sick for my entire life but this truly hit me like a freight train Im taking the week off of school but Im beyond overwhelmed as is My anxiety and depression have been in full force since the year began but this has brought me to new levels of both I could not even imagine If anyone has any preventive tips for me to combat these feelings let me know 


Im starting to think that I dont have mental issues and its all just an unbreakable behavioral pattern I grew up developing The more I read about mental health the sadder I get it feeds my capacity to fail and failing always leads to subtle destructive behavior that I dont notice until after the fact I would think it is something good for me then realize its the opposite and I only did it to run away from the problem The worst part is now Im aware of the pattern and so scared of doing anything at all


Its my 18th birthday I have no friends I just feel so alone My family is trying to make it a good day even though I said from the start i dont wanna do anything now there is people coming I dont know if I can do that Ive been crying ever since I woke up sometimes I calm down but as soon as I stand up I have to cry again I know Im making my family feel shitty and they didnt do anything wrong but I just want to be alone
